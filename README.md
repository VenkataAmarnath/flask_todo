# To-Do List Management Project

This project is a web-based To-Do List Management application that allows users to manage tasks for different users, update task statuses, and add new tasks and users. The application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, and a Python Flask backend API for data management.

## Features

- **Add New User**: Create new users for task assignments.
- **Add New Task**: Assign a task to a specific user and set its status.
- **Update Task Status**: Modify the status of a task (e.g., *Yet to Start*, *In Progress*, *Completed*).
- **Filter Tasks by User**: View tasks related to a selected user.
- **View All Tasks**: Display all tasks in a table format.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed on your machine
- A web browser to run the application
- Basic familiarity with Python and JavaScript is helpful but not required

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list-management.git
    cd todo-list-management
    ```

2. **Install required Python packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Start the Flask server**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4. **Open `index.html` in a browser**:
    - Use "Open with Live Server" if testing locally, or access via `http://localhost:5000` if using Flask’s server.

### Usage

1. **Add a User**: Enter a name and click **Add User**.
2. **Add a Task**: Choose a user, type in the task name, select its status, and click **Add Task**.
3. **Update a Task's Status**: Select a user, pick their task, choose a new status, and click **Update Status**.
4. **View Tasks by User**: Select a user to see only their tasks.

### Notes on Static Deployment

- This project currently requires a server to fetch data from `data.json` and `users.json`, so it won’t fully function on GitHub Pages or other static hosts.

## Scope for Future Enhancements

- **Backend API**: Extend backend functionality to handle dynamic data updates.
- **User Authentication**: Add user login and registration.
- **Data Storage**: Integrate a database for persistent task and user data storage.
